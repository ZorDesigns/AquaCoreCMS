= AquaCoreCMS -- Thanks/credits file =

AquaCoreCMS is content managing system written from FailZorD also known as GreekTheGeek for sole purpose of learning. 
This is written in pure PHP!
The cause of this Project is to achieve what a standalone Content Management System can do because most of the 
system available right now cost money and offer less that they are supposed to.
